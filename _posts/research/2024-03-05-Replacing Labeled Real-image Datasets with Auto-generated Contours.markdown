summary: "This study demonstrates that formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) can achieve or surpass the performance of ImageNet-21k pre-training for Vision Transformers (ViTs) without using real images or relying on human or self-supervision. Notably, a ViT-Base model pre-trained with FDSL achieved 82.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k, exceeding the 81.8% accuracy from ImageNet-21k pre-training, under identical conditions. Synthetic images generated by FDSL circumvent issues associated with real images, such as privacy/copyright concerns, labeling inaccuracies, and biases, offering a promising avenue for pre-training general models. Investigating the effectiveness of synthetic images, we explored two hypotheses: the importance of object contours in FDSL datasets and the impact of increasing parameter complexity for label creation on pre-training performance. Our findings suggest that simple object contours can match fractal-based dataset performance and that increasing pre-training task difficulty enhances fine-tuning accuracy."
