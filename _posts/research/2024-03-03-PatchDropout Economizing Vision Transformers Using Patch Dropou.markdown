summary: "Vision transformers (ViTs) can outperform CNNs in various vision tasks but are limited by high computational and memory needs, especially for high-resolution images like medical image classification. Efforts to optimize ViTs are complex, requiring significant changes. However, we introduce PatchDropout, a simple technique that drops random image patches during training, cutting computational and memory demands by at least 50% on datasets like IMAGENET and even more with larger images. On the high-resolution CSAW medical dataset, PatchDropout achieves a 5Ã— reduction in resources and improves performance, enabling more efficient model scaling and parameter tuning within fixed computational or memory budgets"
