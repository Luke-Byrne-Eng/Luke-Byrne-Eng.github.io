summary: "Implicit neural representations, parameterized by continuous, differentiable neural networks, offer numerous advantages over conventional representations. However, existing architectures struggle with fine detail and fail to capture spatial and temporal derivatives, crucial for many physical signals described by partial differential equations. We introduce sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) utilizing periodic activation functions, ideal for representing complex signals and their derivatives. Analyzing SIREN activation statistics informs a principled initialization scheme. We demonstrate SIRENs' efficacy in representing various signals and solving boundary value problems, including Eikonal, Poisson, Helmholtz, and wave equations. Additionally, we integrate SIRENs with hypernetworks to learn priors over the SIREN function space. Visit the project website for detailed demonstrations."
