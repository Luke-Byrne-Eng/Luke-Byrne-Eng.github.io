summary: "he quest for a universal sequence model capable of handling data across different tasks and modalities, especially long-range dependencies, faces challenges with conventional models like RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers, which struggle with very long sequences. A promising approach using state space models (SSM) showed potential but had high computational demands. We introduce the Structured State Space sequence model (S4), a more efficient parameterization of SSM, demonstrating strong empirical performance across various benchmarks, including achieving state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforming prior models in efficiency and speed."
