summary: "Data augmentation improves generalization, and robustness against image corruptions. However, the use of complex augmentation pipelines typically involves tuning of an enormous number of hyper parameters. RandAugment addresses this by reducing the search space. RandAugment's interpretable hyperparameter also facilitates exploration of data augmentation's impact across different models and datasets."
