summary: "This paper investigates the robustness of Vision Transformer (ViT) variants against common corruptions. The benchmarking reveals that overlapping patch embedding and convolutional feed-forward networks (FFNs) significantly enhance ViT robustness. The study also scrutinizes the effectiveness of CNN-based data augmentation strategies when applied to ViTs, finding that adversarial noise training is effective, while fourier-domain augmentation falls short. A new conditional method for generating dynamic augmentation parameters based on input images is proposed, achieving state-of-the-art robustness against common corruptions."
