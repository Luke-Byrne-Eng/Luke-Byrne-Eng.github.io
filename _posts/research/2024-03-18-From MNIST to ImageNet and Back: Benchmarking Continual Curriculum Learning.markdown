summary: "Continual learning (CL) is a promising trend in machine learning, aiming to develop robust models and strategies for dynamic environments by incorporating new knowledge while retaining past knowledge. CL research is fragmented, with various protocols, tasks, datasets, and metrics, often not reflecting real-world complexity and tailored to specific strategies. This work addresses this gap by introducing two novel CL benchmarks with heterogeneous tasks from six image datasets, varying in complexity and quality. These benchmarks fairly evaluate state-of-the-art CL strategies in scenarios closer to real-world conditions. The benchmarks present tasks in both increasing and decreasing complexity, assessing models' ability to exploit task structure. The work emphasizes a rigorous, reproducible evaluation protocol for measuring generalization and memory retention in models. Experimental results show that popular CL strategies perform poorly on these benchmarks, exhibit high forgetting, and struggle with curriculum task ordering. These findings underscore the need for rigorous comparisons and the development of new CL strategies for complex scenarios."
