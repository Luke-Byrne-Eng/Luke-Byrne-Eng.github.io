summary: "This study explores fundamental training components for self-supervised ViT, identifying instability as a key issue that undermines accuracy despite seemingly successful outcomes. By addressing these instabilities, the paper demonstrates improvements in training stability and accuracy. Results and ablations are benchmarked across MoCo v3 and other self-supervised frameworks."
