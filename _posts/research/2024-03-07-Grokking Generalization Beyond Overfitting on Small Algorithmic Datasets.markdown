summary: "This paper introduces the concept of grokking, a sudden onset of perfect generalisation long after overfitting, on small, algorithmically generated datasets. The study also finds that generalization on smaller datasets requires more optimization. The authors suggest that such datasets are ideal for investigating the puzzling phenomenon of how overparametrized neural networks generalize beyond simply memorizing their training data."
