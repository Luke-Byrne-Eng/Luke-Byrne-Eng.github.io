summary: "The paper introduces a system that trains deep neural networks for object detection using only synthetic images generated with domain randomization. This involves randomizing non-realistic simulator parameters like lighting and object textures, allowing the network to identify essential object features. Their findings show that networks can achieve impressive performance using just synthetic data, and further improve with fine-tuning on real data. This suggests the potential of using cost-effective synthetic data for training, avoiding the need to acquire vast amounts of real-world data or create detailed synthetic environments. They validate their method on car bounding box detection using the KITTI dataset."
