summary: "This study introduces a novel methodology utilizing circular harmonics to explore the design space of contour-oriented synthetic datasets for formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL). The authors identify the optimal FDSL parameters and maximize synthetic image variety, which is crucial for success. Using the newly created VisualAtom-21k for pre-training, ViT-Base achieves a top-1 accuracy of 83.7% on ImageNet-1k, nearing the 84.2% achieved with JFT-300M pre-training but with significantly fewer images. The authors demonstrate FDSL's potential for continuous improvement and its ability to avoid issues common to real images, such as privacy/copyright concerns, labeling costs/errors, and ethical biases."
