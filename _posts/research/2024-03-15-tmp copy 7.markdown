summary: "We introduce four new real-world distribution shift datasets covering various changes such as image style, blurriness, geographic location, and camera operation. We evaluate existing methods for out-of-distribution robustness and find that larger models and artificial data augmentations improve robustness on real-world shifts, contrary to prior claims. We observe that improvements in artificial benchmarks can transfer to real-world shifts. Additionally, we propose a new data augmentation method that outperforms models pretrained with significantly more labeled data. While some methods aid with texture and local image statistics shifts, they do not assist with geographic changes. Our findings underscore the importance of studying multiple distribution shifts concurrently, as no single method consistently enhances robustness."
