summary: "This study aims to enhance our comprehension of deep learning dynamics by analyzing deep linear neural networks. Despite their linear input-output mapping, these networks display nonlinear gradient descent dynamics, resulting in phenomena like prolonged plateaus and swift transitions to improved solutions. Through analytical exploration, we reveal that as network depth increases indefinitely, learning speed can remain finite under specific initial conditions. Unsupervised pretraining, under certain data conditions, can discover these favorable initial conditions, unlike random Gaussian initializations. We introduce a novel class of random orthogonal initial conditions that, akin to unsupervised pretraining, enable depth-independent learning. These conditions also ensure gradient propagation in deep nonlinear networks, particularly when operating at the edge of chaos."
