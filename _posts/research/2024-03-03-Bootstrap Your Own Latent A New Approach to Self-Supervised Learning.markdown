summary: "We introduce BYOL, a novel self-supervised learning method for image representation without using negative pairs. Utilizing two networks, BYOL trains one to predict the representation of an image as seen by the other under a different view, updating the latter with the former's slow-moving average. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods, it achieves up to 79.6% accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet models, performing equally or better on transfer and semi-supervised tasks. Code and models are available on GitHub."
