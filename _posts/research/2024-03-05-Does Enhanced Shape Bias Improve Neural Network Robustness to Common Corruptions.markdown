summary: "Incorporating diverse image styles into CNN training data reduces texture bias, enhances shape recognition, and improves resilience against common image corruptions. This is typically explained as decreasing model reliance on high frequency texture information. This paper challenges this explaniation through large scale testing with natural images, edge information, and stylization, finding no direct link between shape bias and robustness. The enhanced corruption robustness is instead attributed to style variation in data augmentation, with increased shape bias being an indirect effect."
