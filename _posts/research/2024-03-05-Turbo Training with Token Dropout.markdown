summary: "This paper introduces Turbo training, an efficient method for training Transformers on video-related tasks. The authors present a simple yet versatile training paradigm applicable to multiple video tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness across action classification, video-language representation learning, and long-video activity classification. Turbo training achieves competitive performance with up to 4Ã— speed-up and reduced memory usage, enabling long-schedule video-language training and end-to-end long-video training with limited resources, outperforming or matching previous resource-intensive methods.."
