summary: "The paper introduces Unsupervised Neural Architecture Search (UnNAS), questioning the necessity of human-annotated labels for discovering effective neural architectures. Two experimental setups sample-based and search-based were investigated. The sample-based approach evaluated 500 diverse architectures trained with both supervised and unsupervised objectives, revealing a high correlation between the architecture rankings with and without labels. The search-based experiments employed DARTS, a recognized NAS algorithm, with various unsupervised objectives. The architectures identified without labels performed competitively compared to those found with labels. The findings suggested that image statistics alone could be sufficient for identifying efficient neural architectures, potentially eliminating the need for human-annotated labels."
