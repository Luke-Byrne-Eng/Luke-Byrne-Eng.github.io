summary: "Recent studies reveal that deep neural networks maintain high performance levels even when trained with binary quantized weights. This paper shows deep networks have significant resilience to various test-time distortions, including noise and non-linear projections, with robustness extending beyond binary quantization. The authors propose a stochastic projection rule that sets a new benchmark CIFAR-10 without data augmentation."
