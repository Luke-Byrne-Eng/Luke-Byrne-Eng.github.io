summary: "This paper introduces the fast feedforward (FFF) architecture, a log-time alternative to feedforward networks. FFFs are up to 220x faster than feedforward networks, up to 6x faster than mixture-of-experts networks, and exhibit better training properties than mixtures of experts thanks to noiseless conditional execution."
