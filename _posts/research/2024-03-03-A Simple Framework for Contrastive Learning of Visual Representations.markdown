summary: "This paper introduces SimCLR, a method for contrastive learning of visual representations. Authors find that data augmentation composition, a learnable nonlinear transformation to the contrastive loss, and larger batch size with more training steps improve representation quality. A linear classifier using SimCLR's self-supervised representations reaches 76.5% top-1 accuracy, a 7% improvement over the prior best and equal to supervised ResNet-50. With only 1% of labels, it achieves 85.8% top-5 accuracy, outdoing AlexNet with 100 times fewer labels."
