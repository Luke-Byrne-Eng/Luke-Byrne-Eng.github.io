summary: "The authors investigate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5/4, Claude, and LLaMa by presenting them with a simple common sense problem. Despite high performance on standardized benchmarks, these models show dramatic failures in solving the problem, displaying overconfidence and providing nonsensical justifications for incorrect answers. Standard interventions, like enhanced prompting, fail to improve outcomes. This study urges the scientific community to reassess LLM capabilities and develop benchmarks that better detect reasoning deficits to guide future improvements"
