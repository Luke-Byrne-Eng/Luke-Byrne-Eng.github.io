summary: "This article provides an extensive review of vision transformer techniques applied specifically to human action recognition. These action transformers are analyzed and categorized based on their architecture, modality, and objectives. The review explores how action transformers encode spatio-temporal data, reduce dimensions, construct frame patches and spatio-temporal cubes, and various representation techniques. It also examines optimizing spatio-temporal attention in transformers for longer sequences and different learning strategies like self-supervised and zero-shot learning with their respective loss functions. Additionally, it assesses progress in benchmark evaluation scores and discusses challenges and future directions in this research area."
