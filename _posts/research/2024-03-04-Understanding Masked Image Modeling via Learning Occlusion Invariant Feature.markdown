summary: "Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has been successful in self-supervised visual recognition, yet its working mechanism remains unclear, especially compared to siamese approaches like contrastive learning. This study introduces a new perspective that MIM implicitly learns occlusion-invariant features, similar to the invariances learned by siamese methods. The Authors show that MIM can be interpreted within a unified framework alongside traditional methods, differing only in data transformations and similarity measurements."
