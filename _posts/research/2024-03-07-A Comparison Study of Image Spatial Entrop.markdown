summary: "Deep neural networks, while effective in complex vision tasks, suffer from overfitting. Current image augmentation techniques, largely linear and hand-crafted like scale, flip, and color jitter, fail to produce sufficiently challenging examples. We introduce a new augmentation approach, Mask-Reconstruct Augmentation (MRA), leveraging self-supervised masked autoencoders to generate distorted inputs. This method, inspired by masked image modeling's success in self-supervised learning, uses nonlinear transformations for regularization. Our extensive testing across various image classification benchmarks demonstrates MRA's ability to significantly improve performance in supervised, semi-supervised, and few-shot classification tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/haohang96/MRA."
