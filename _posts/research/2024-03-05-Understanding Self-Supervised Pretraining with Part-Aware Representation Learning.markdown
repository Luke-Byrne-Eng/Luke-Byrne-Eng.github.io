summary: "This paper investigates how self-supervised pretraining methods learn part-aware representations. The authors describe contrastive learning as transforming part representations into whole object representations and masked image modeling as inferring masked object parts from visible ones, suggesting that these methods predispose encoders to recognize object parts. Through empirical comparison, they find that while fully-supervised models excel in object-level recognition, self-supervised models, particularly those using contrastive learning and masked image modeling, perform better in part-level recognition. Combining contrastive learning and masked image modeling further enhances performance."
