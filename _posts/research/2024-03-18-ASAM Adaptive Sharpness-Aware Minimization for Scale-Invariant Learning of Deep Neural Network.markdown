summary: "Recent advances in learning algorithms have highlighted the importance of the sharpness of the loss surface as a key indicator of the generalization gap, achieving state-of-the-art results. However, traditional sharpness measures, defined within a fixed region, suffer from sensitivity to parameter scaling, weakening their predictive value for the generalization gap. This paper introduces a scale-invariant measure, adaptive sharpness, along with a new generalization bound. We present a new learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), which leverages this bound. Our experiments across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASAM significantly enhances model generalization."
