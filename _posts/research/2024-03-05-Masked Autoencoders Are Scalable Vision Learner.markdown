summary: "This paper presents masked autoencoders (MAE) as efficient and scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. MAE involves masking random patches of an input image and reconstructing the missing pixels using an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and a lightweight decoder. Masking a significant portion of the input image creates a challenging yet informative self-supervisory task. These innovations allow for efficient training of large models, tripling training speed and enhancing accuracy. A vanilla ViT-Huge model reaches top accuracy (87.8%) on ImageNet-1K data among similar methods. The model's transfer performance in downstream tasks surpasses that of supervised pre-training, indicating promising scaling potential."
