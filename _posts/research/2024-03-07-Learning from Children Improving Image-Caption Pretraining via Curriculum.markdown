summary: "This paper introduces a curriculum learning framework for image-caption pretraining, inspired by children's language learning from cognitive science, to address the challenges of aligning multiple concepts from captions to objects in images. The method starts with simple image-caption pairs and gradually increases complexity by adding more concepts, leveraging knowledge from each phase for subsequent learning. This approach outperforms traditional image-caption training across various settings, including starting from scratch, using pretrained encoders, and in low data scenarios."
