summary: "Masked image modeling (MIM), a self-supervised pre-training method, enhances vision tasks using Vision transformers by masking and reconstructing parts of an image. The compatibility of MIM with CNNs and its operational principle are unclear. this study reveals that MIM improves generalized feature extraction through middle-order patch interactions and introduces Architecture-Agnostic Masked Image Modeling (A2MIM), compatible with both Transformers and CNNs. Extensive testing demonstrates A2MIM's ability to enhance representation learning and transferability to various tasks without specialized modifications."
