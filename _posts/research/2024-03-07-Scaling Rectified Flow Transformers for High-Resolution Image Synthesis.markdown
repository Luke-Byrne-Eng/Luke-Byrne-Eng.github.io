summary: "This paper focuses on improving diffusion models for high-dimensional data like images. The authors enhance noise sampling techniques for training rectified flow models, prioritizing perceptually relevant scales. Their large-scale study shows superior performance over established diffusion methods in high-resolution text-to-image synthesis. A new transformer-based architecture is introduced for better text comprehension, typography, and human preference in text-to-image generation. The findings demonstrate predictable scaling trends, with lower validation loss tied to improved synthesis. The largest models outperform state-of-the-art approaches."
