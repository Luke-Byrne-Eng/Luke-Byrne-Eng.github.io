summary: "We present four novel real-world distribution shift datasets encompassing changes in image style, blurriness, location, camera settings, and more. Evaluating existing methods for enhancing out-of-distribution robustness, we discover that employing larger models and artificial data augmentations can enhance robustness against real-world distribution shifts, contradicting prior claims. Our findings demonstrate that improvements in artificial robustness benchmarks can indeed transfer to real-world distribution shifts, contrary to prior assumptions. Additionally, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique that surpasses models pretrained with significantly more labeled data, emphasizing its efficacy in addressing real-world distribution shifts. While some methods consistently mitigate texture and local image statistics shifts, they fail to address other shifts like geographic changes. Our results underscore the necessity for future research to examine multiple distribution shifts concurrently, as no single method consistently improves robustness across all evaluated scenarios."
