summary: "Deep representations offer promising performance for downstream tasks but lack interpretability, posing a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce Non-negative Contrastive Learning (NCL), a refinement of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aimed at generating interpretable features. NCL enforces non-negativity constraints, akin to NMF, resulting in sparse and disentangled representations, unlike standard contrastive learning (CL). We establish theoretical guarantees on NCL's identifiability and downstream generalization. Empirically, NCL outperforms CL in feature disentanglement, selection, and downstream classification tasks. Moreover, NCL can be extended to other learning scenarios, benefiting supervised learning."
