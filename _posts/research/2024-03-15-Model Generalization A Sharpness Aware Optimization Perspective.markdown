summary: "This study investigates the effectiveness of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) and adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (ASAM) in enhancing model generalization. Through three experiments, we assess their impact from a sharpness-aware perspective. Results demonstrate that optimization techniques based on sharpness awareness can bolster model generalization. Furthermore, ASAM exhibits potential for enhancing generalization performance on un-normalized data, though additional research is required for validation."
