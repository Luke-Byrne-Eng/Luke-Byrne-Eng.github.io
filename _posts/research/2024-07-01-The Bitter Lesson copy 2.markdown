summary: "Rich Sutton's bitter lesson. Methods and techniques that leverage computation over human knowledge are, in the long term, always proven to be better. This is primarly due to Moore's law. Over the 3.5 years of a PhD computer power will more than double, making methods that were unfeasable at the start of the program entirely feasible by the end of it."
