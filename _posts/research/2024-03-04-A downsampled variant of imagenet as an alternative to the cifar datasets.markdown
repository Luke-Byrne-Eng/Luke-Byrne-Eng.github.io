summary: "This paper proposes downsampled versions of ImageNet: ImageNet64x64, ImageNet32x32, and ImageNet16x16, which maintain the same number of classes and images but with reduced resolution. This approach significantly speeds up experiments while preserving similar optimal hyperparameters characteristics."
