summary: "Label smoothing has been empirically shown to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. However, its mathematical underpinnings remain unclear. This paper explains label smoothing's effectiveness in controlling generalization loss, especially in scenarios with partially incorrect training labels. The authors identify a method for calculating a label smoothing value that minimizes generalization loss."
