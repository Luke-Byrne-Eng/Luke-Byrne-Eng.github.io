summary: "The distributional simplicity bias (DSB) theory suggests neural networks first learn basic patterns in data before understanding more complex correlations. We provide new evidence supporting DSB, showing networks initially excel with data matching training set's simple statistics but this ability diminishes later. Extending DSB to discrete domains, we demonstrate an equivalence between n-gram frequencies and vector moments, also observing this bias in large language models (LLMs). Additionally, by adjusting low-level statistics of images to resemble another class, we reveal that networks in early training phases misclassify these edited images as if they belonged to the target class."
