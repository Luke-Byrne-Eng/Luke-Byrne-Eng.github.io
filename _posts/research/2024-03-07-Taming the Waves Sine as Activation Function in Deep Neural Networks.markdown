summary: "This paper examines the challenges of training deep neural networks with sinusoidal activation functions, despite their successful use in specific applications. It explains the difficulty in training due to the emergence of numerous shallow local minima from the architecture. The study also reveals that successful learning in typical classification tasks occurs when the network effectively disregards the periodic cycles. Furthermore, it demonstrates that for certain non-trivial tasks, networks with sinusoidal activations can outperform those using traditional monotonic functions."
