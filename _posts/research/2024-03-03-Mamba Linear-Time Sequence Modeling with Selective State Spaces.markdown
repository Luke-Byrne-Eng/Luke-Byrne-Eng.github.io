summary: "This paper introduces the Mamba archetecture, a selective state space model (SSSM) with input dependance. Mamba has better speed and scalability compared to transformers in various domains including language, audio, and genomics, especially in tasks involving extremely long sequences. Authors also present a hardware efficient scanning mechanism that is used in Mamba."
