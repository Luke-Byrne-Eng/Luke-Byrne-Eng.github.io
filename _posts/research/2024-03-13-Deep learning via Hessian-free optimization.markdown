summary: "We present a novel 2nd-order optimization method inspired by the Hessian-free approach, applied to deep auto-encoders. Achieving superior results without pre-training compared to Hinton & Salakhutdinov (2006), our method is practical, user-friendly, scalable to large datasets, and versatile across various model classes. Additionally, we address the challenge of pathological curvature in deep learning, highlighting how our method effectively mitigates this issue."
