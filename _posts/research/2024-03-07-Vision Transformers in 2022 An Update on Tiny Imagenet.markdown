summary: "The paper focuses on evaluating the performance of recent advancements in image transformers, such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), Class Attention in Image Transformer (CaiT), and Swin Transformers, on the Tiny ImageNet dataset for transfer learning tasks. While these models are typically trained on large datasets like ImageNet-21k and then fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k, their assessments often overlook the Tiny ImageNet benchmark. The study updates the performance of vision transformers on Tiny ImageNet, highlighting that Swin Transformers outperform existing benchmarks with a validation accuracy of 91.35%. This underscores the importance of evaluating these models on the Tiny ImageNet dataset for transfer learning performance."
