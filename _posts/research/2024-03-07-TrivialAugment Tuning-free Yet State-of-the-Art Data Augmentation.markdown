summary: "TrivialAugment, a parameter-free and surprisingly effective automatic augmentation method, applies a single augmentation to each image and outperforms existing methods with minimal complexity and cost. We conducted extensive experiments to validate its performance against state-of-the-art methods across various image classification scenarios and explored its effectiveness through multiple ablation studies involving different augmentation spaces and methods. Our work includes a user-friendly interface and fully shared codebase to encourage adoption and reproducibility. Highlighting a stagnation in automatic augmentation research, we conclude with proposed best practices for future advancements in the field."
