summary: "This paper introduces Mask-Reconstruct Augmentation (MRA), an image augmentation technique that leverages self-supervised masked autoencoders to generate distorted inputs and address the issue of overfitting in deep neural networks. Inspired by the success of masked image modeling in self-supervised learning, MRA uses nonlinear transformations for regularization, as opposed to current hand-crafted linear techniques like scale, flip, and color jitter. Extensive testing across various image classification benchmarks demonstrates MRA's ability to significantly improve performance in supervised, semi-supervised, and few-shot classification tasks."
