summary: "Formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) uses synthetic images from mathematical formulas, like fractals, for pre-training vision transformers, demonstrating competitive performance on various downstream tasks. This study proposes that generating different instances within the same category in FDSL acts as data augmentation. Given this perspective, a one-instance fractal database (OFDB) is developed where only a single image per category is present. Despite OFDB's significantly smaller size of 21k images compared to ImageNet-21k's 14M comparable or superior results are obtaine to models pre-trained on ImageNet-21k in ImageNet-1k fine-tuning."
