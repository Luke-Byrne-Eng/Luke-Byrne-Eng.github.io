summary: "This paper introduces benchmarks for evaluating the robustness of image classifiers, focusing on common corruptions and perturbations rather than adversarial ones. The benchmarks include IMAGENET-C, which assesses corruption robustness and identifies preferred classifiers for safety-critical roles, and IMAGENET-P, a new dataset for evaluating perturbation robustness. Findings suggest minimal differences in corruption robustness between AlexNet and ResNet classifiers, while also identifying methods to improve robustness, including the unexpected benefit of a bypassed adversarial defense. These benchmarks aim to guide future research towards more generally robust networks."
