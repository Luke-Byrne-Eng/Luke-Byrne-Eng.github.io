summary: "We propose a method for algorithm discovery via program search, focusing on optimizing deep neural network training. Our approach, Lion (EvoLved Sign Momentum), is memory-efficient and achieves comparable or superior performance to widely-used optimizers such as Adam and Adafactor across various tasks. Specifically, Lion enhances accuracy on tasks like image classification and vision-language contrastive learning, while reducing training compute. Notably, Lion exhibits improved performance with larger batch sizes and requires smaller learning rates compared to Adam. Despite its effectiveness, Lion has limitations, which we analyze, and provide insights into its deployment and performance. Our implementation is publicly available and has been successfully utilized in Google's search ads CTR model."
