summary: "Learning rate is crucial in neural network training, yet existing schedules lack theoretical backing, often leading to suboptimal choices made through trial and error. To address this, we propose LEAP, a plugin enhancing various learning rate schedules by introducing perturbations. This simple yet effective strategy favors flat minima, ensuring better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate LEAP's ability to improve performance across diverse datasets and learning rate schedules, including constant ones."
