summary: "Deep learning (DL) is widely used in intelligent systems and real-life applications, but its deployment on computationally limited and energy-constrained devices requires efficient technologies like Binary Neural Networks (BNN). BNNs save significant storage, computation cost, and energy, making them ideal for small devices, despite the trade-offs in memory and performance. This article offers a comprehensive review of BNN developments, focusing on 1-bit activations and weights. It covers the evolution of BNN, from early models to advanced algorithms and design aspects, and addresses BNN optimization, deployment, computing architectures, and diverse applications. It also outlines potential research directions in BNN technology."
