summary: "This paper analyzes the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) with texture and shape biases against Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs). Through evaluation, it finds that shape-biased models alone do not significantly enhance adversarial robustness. However, combining texture and shape-biased models into ensembles can increase universal adversarial robustness while retaining high performance."
