summary: "Dropout is typically interpreted as turning the test time network into an ensemble of the thinner training networks. This paper argues that dropout can also be interpreted as a kind of data augmentation in image space. Authors present an approach to project the dropout noise within a network back into the input space, visualising the augmented versions of the training data, and show that training a deterministic network on the augmented samples yields similar results. Authors then propose a new dropout noise scheme and show that it improves dropout results without adding significant
