summary: "This study investigates the optimization landscape of deep linear neural networks with square loss, focusing on the role of non-strict saddle points in algorithm dynamics, which has been previously understudied. We conduct a comprehensive second-order analysis, identifying global minimizers, strict, and non-strict saddle points among all critical points, alongside their critical values. Our findings, based on conditions related to the ranks of partial matrix products, contribute insights into global convergence and implicit regularization observed in optimizing linear neural networks. Additionally, we offer an explicit parameterization of global minimizers and identify extensive sets of strict and non-strict saddle points."
