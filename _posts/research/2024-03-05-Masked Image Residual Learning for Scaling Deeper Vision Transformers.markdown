summary: "Training deeper Vision Transformers (ViTs) presents challenges, including a degradation problem in deeper layers during masked image modeling (MIM) pre-training. In this paper Masked Image Residual Learning (MIRL), a self-supervised learning framework, was introduced to alleviate the degradation issue and enable effective scaling of ViT depth for performance improvement. MIRL redefines the pre-training objective for deep ViT layers as learning to recover the residual of the masked image. Extensive testing shows that MIRL allows deeper ViTs to be optimized more effectively, enhancing accuracy with increased depth."
