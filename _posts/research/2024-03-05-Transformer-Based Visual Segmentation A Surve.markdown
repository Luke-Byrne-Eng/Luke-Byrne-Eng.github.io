summary: "This survey offers an extensive examination of transformer-based visual segmentation, a field crucial for applications in autonomous driving, image editing, robot sensing, and medical analysis. With the advent of deep learning, and especially transformers—neural networks excelling in vision tasks through self-attention—there has been significant progress in segmentation tasks. We cover the evolution from convolutional methods to the emergence of vision transformers, providing a unified framework that simplifies understanding recent advancements. The survey discusses various transformer-based segmentation approaches, modifications, and applications, highlighting specific areas like 3D point cloud, foundation model tuning, domain-aware, efficient, and medical segmentation. Additionally, it re-evaluates these methods on established datasets, outlines current challenges, and suggests future research directions.
