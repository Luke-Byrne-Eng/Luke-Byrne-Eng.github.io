summary: "This paper introduces sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs), which utilize periodic activation functions like Sin to effectively capture complex natural signals and their derivatives, addressing the limitations of neural networks parameterized for continuous, differentiable signal representations. The authors' analysis leads to a principled initialization strategy, enabling the representation of images, wavefields, video, sound, and derivatives. SIRENs are also applied in solving boundary value problems like Eikonal equations, the Poisson equation, and the Helmholtz and wave equations. The authors extend SIRENs' use with hypernetworks to learn priors for SIREN functions."
