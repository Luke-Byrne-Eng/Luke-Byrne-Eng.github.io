summary: "This paper explores the challenges in training deep neural networks that use sinusoidal activation functions. The authors explain that the difficulty arises from the emergence of numerous shallow local minima in the loss landscape. The study reveals that successful learning in typical classification tasks occurs when the network effectively ignores the periodic cycles of the sinusoidal functions. However, for certain non-trivial tasks, networks with sinusoidal activations can outperform those using traditional monotonic activation functions."
