summary: "Recent non-contrastive learning methods like BYOL, SimSiam, SwAV, and DINO have shown that asymmetric architectural designs can achieve good self-supervised visual learning performance by aligning positive pairs alone, despite a lack of unified theoretical understanding on how these designs prevent feature collapse. This study introduces the Rank Differential Mechanism (RDM) as a unified theoretical framework for non-contrastive learning. RDM demonstrates that these asymmetric designs maintain a consistent rank difference in output features, enhancing effective dimensionality and preventing feature collapse. Unlike previous theories, RDM applies to designs both with and without a predictor, offering a comprehensive understanding of non-contrastive learning methods and guiding the development of new variants. Experiments confirm that these variants perform comparably, if not better than, existing methods on benchmark datasets."
