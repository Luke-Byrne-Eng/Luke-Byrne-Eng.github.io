summary: "This study explores self-supervision through automatic colorization as an alternative to ImageNet pretraining. Self-supervised training achieved state-of-the-art results on VOC segmentation and classification tasks without relying on ImageNet labels. This paper highlights the significance of loss formulation, training specifics, and network architecture when pretraining through colorization. It also revisits and questions the ImageNet pretraining approach, including the necessity of training data volume, label quantity, and feature adaptability upon fine-tuning. The findings suggest that colorization offers a better supervisory signal comparable to various types of ImageNet pretraining."
