summary: "This paper introduces the concept of delayed robustness to describe DNNs becoming robust to adversarial examples post-generalization. This emergence is explained through a measure of local complexity, analyzing the density of linear regions in the DNN input space. The authors find that during training linear regions emerge near training samples with the nonlinearities being forced towards decision boundries."
