summary: "This paper explores the effectiveness of using synthetic data, generated by graphics simulators, for pre-training models in computer vision, addressing the challenges posed by using real-image datasets like high costs and ethical concerns. It highlights that the performance of models on downstream tasks varies with different simulation parameters, suggesting a tailored approach to synthetic data generation for optimal results. The introduction of Task2Sim, a model that maps downstream task requirements to optimal simulation parameters, allows for the generation of synthetic pre-training data customized for specific tasks. Task2Sim demonstrates significant improvements in model performance on a wide range of tasks without additional training for new tasks, showing potential to rival pre-training with real images from Imagenet."
