summary: "The paper investigates the use of synthetic data generated by graphics simulators for pre-training computer vision models. The authors find that model performance on downstream tasks varies with different simulation parameters used to generate the synthetic data. They introduce Task2Sim, a model that maps the requirements of a downstream task to the optimal simulation parameters for generating synthetic pre-training data."
