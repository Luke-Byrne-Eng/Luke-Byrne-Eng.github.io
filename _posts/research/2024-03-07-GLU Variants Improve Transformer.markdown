summary: "Gated Linear Units (GLUs) involve the component-wise product of two linear projections, with one undergoing a sigmoid function. Exploring GLU variants by substituting the sigmoid with other nonlinear or linear functions within the Transformer model's feed-forward sublayers, we find certain variants outperform the conventional ReLU or GELU activations in terms of quality."
