summary: "Building robust models in computer vision requires invariance to image corruptions like warping, noise, or color shifts. Despite new data augmentations improving performance on ImageNet-C, the correlation between data augmentations and test-time corruptions remains unclear. This paper introduces Minimal Sample Distance, and demonstrates a strong correlation between augmentation-corruption similarity and performance. Authors argue that training with augmentations that are perceptually similar to corruptions enhances test error."
