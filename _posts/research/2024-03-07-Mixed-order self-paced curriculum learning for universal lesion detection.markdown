summary: "Self-paced curriculum learning (SCL) has been effective in various fields, employing easy-to-hard sampling based on data difficulty. However, in medical image analysis tasks like universal lesion detection, it faces challenges due to inaccurate difficulty estimation and the under-utilization of hard samples. This paper introduces a novel approach, mixed-order self-paced curriculum learning (Mo-SCL), which combines uncertainty and loss for better difficulty estimation and incorporates both hard and easy samples in training batches to address these issues. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, Mo-SCL is shown to enhance lesion detection accuracy in state-of-the-art methods without additional network modifications."
