summary: "Existing methods for controlling language models focus on training desired behaviors, but often lack the flexibility needed for diverse applications. We address this with the Pink Elephant Problem, demonstrating the need for language models to adapt to different contexts by avoiding certain topics (the Pink Elephant) in favor of others (Grey Elephant). We introduce Direct Principle Feedback (DPF), an adaptation of Constitutional AI that improves control by directly applying critiques and revisions without ranking responses. Our study shows that a 13B LLaMA 2 model fine-tuned with DPF on a synthetic dataset outperforms existing models and matches GPT-4 in managing the Pink Elephant Problem."
