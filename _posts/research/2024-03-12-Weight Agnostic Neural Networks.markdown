summary: "This study investigates the importance of neural network architectures versus weight parameters for task performance. We introduce a method to find architectures capable of performing tasks without weight training. By assigning random weights, we show that minimal architectures can achieve notable performance on various tasks, including reinforcement learning and MNIST classification."
