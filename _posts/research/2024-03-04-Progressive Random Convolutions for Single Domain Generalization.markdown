summary: "To address the limitations of Random Convolutions (RandConv) augmentation in single domain generalization, this paper introduce a Progressive Random Convolution (Pro-RandConv) method that layers random convolutions with small kernel sizes to maintain semantic integrity and enhance style diversity without increasing kernel size. Additionally, the authors enhance the random convolution block with deformable offsets and affine transformations for further texture and contrast diversification. This simple method surpasses the current state-of-the-art in single domain generalization benchmarks without relying on complex generators or adversarial learning."
