summary: "Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT generate text that appears truthful but is not concerned with actual truth, making it more accurate to label their false claims as bullshit rather than lies or hallucinations. This distinction is important because current descriptions like hallucinations mislead the public and policymakers about the nature of LLM outputs."
