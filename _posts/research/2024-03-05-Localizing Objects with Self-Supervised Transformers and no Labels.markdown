summary: "This paper introdices LOST, a method for unsupervised object localization in images. LOST utilizes activation features from a self-supervised pre-trained vision transformer. Unlike other methods, LOST works on individual images without relying on external object proposals or image collection exploration. It surpasses existing object discovery methods by up to 8 CorLoc points on PASCAL VOC 2012. Training a class-agnostic detector on the objects found by LOST further improves performance by 7 points, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised object discovery."
