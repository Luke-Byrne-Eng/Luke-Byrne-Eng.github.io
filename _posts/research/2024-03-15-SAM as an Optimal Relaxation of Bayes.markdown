summary: "We introduce SAM, a method enhancing generalization in deep learning, as a relaxation of the Bayes objective. SAM replaces the expected negative-loss with an optimal convex lower bound derived using the Fenchel biconjugate. This connection enables an Adam-like extension of SAM, offering automatic uncertainty estimates and potential accuracy improvements. Bridging adversarial and Bayesian methods, our work paves the way for robustness enhancement."
