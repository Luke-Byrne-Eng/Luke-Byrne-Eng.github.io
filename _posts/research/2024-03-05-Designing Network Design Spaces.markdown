summary: "This study introduces a novel approach to network design aimed at enhancing the understanding and generalizability of network design principles. The method involves creating spaces for network design that parameterize multiple network populations. A low-dimensional, efficient design space called RegNet is developed, based on modeling network widths and depths through a quantized linear function. The analysis of the RegNet space challenges existing design practices, offering simpler and faster networks effective across various computational budgets. RegNet models surpass EfficientNet models in performance and are up to five times faster on GPUs under similar conditions."
