summary: "Perceptual metrics, designed to replicate human perceptual behavior, are utilized as loss functions in generative models to capture the inherent structure of natural signals like images and audio. This study explores an innovative approach by training a compressive autoencoder on uniform noise instead of natural data in the audio domain. Results demonstrate that using perceptual losses enhances the reconstruction quality of spectrograms and re-synthesized audio at test time compared to standard Euclidean loss, indicating improved generalization to unseen natural signals."
