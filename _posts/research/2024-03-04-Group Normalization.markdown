summary: "Batch Normalization (BN) helps train various deep learning networks but struggles with small batch sizes due to inaccurate statistics estimation, limiting its use in memory-constrained tasks. This paper introduces Group Normalization (GN) as an alternative that divides channels into groups for normalization, independent of batch sizes, offering stable accuracy across various batch sizes. GN shows lower error rates compared to BN in small batches and comparable performance in typical batch sizes."
