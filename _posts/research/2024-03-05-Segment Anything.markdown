summary: "The Segment Anything (SA) project introduces a novel task, model, and the largest image segmentation dataset to date, featuring over 1 billion masks across 11 million licensed and privacy-respecting images. The model consists of two parallel transformer encoders (text prompt and image) and a shared mask decoder. Its zero-shot performance has been evaluated across numerous tasks, often matching or surpassing previous fully supervised results. "
