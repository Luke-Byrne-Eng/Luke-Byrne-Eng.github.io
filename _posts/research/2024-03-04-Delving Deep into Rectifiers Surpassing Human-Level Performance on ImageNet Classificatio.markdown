summary: "In this study, we explore two enhancements to rectifier neural networks for image classification. Firstly, we introduce a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that extends traditional units, offering improved model fitting with negligible additional computational cost. Secondly, we develop a robust initialization strategy tailored for rectifier non-linearities, allowing the training of very deep models from scratch. Using PReLU networks, we achieved a 4.94% top-5 error rate on the ImageNet 2012 dataset, outperforming the previous best result and surpassing human-level performance."
