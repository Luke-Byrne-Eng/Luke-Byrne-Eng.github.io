summary: "This paper introduces the Visual State Space Model (VMamba), inspired by state space models, to achieve linear complexity while maintaining global receptive fields. The addition of a multi-directional Cross-Scan Module (CSM) addresses direction-sensitivity, allowing effective spatial domain traversal. Extensive tests show VMamba's effectiveness in visual perception tasks, especially at higher resolutions."
