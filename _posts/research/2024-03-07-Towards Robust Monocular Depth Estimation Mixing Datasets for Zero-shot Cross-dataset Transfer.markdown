summary: "This paper introduces tools for training monocular depth estimation models with multiple datasets despite incompatible annotations. Their approach uses a robust training objective, multi-objective learning for data integration, and pretraining encoders on auxiliary tasks. Tested across five datasets, including 3D films as a novel data source, their methods achieve superior zero-shot cross-dataset generalization, outperforming existing benchmarks through principled multi-dataset training."
