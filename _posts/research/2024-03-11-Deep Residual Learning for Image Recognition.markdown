summary: "We introduce a residual learning framework to train deeper neural networks effectively. By reformulating layers to learn residual functions relative to inputs, our approach facilitates optimization and achieves higher accuracy with increased depth. Evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of residual networks up to 152 layers deep, outperforming previous architectures. Our method achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set, winning 1st place in the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. Additionally, our deep representations lead to a 28% improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. In the ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, our approach secured 1st place in ImageNet detection, localization, COCO detection, and segmentation tasks."
