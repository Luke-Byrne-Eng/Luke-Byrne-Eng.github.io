summary: "This paper compares Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional legal contract reviewersâ€”Junior Lawyers and Legal Process Outsourcers (LPOs). It evaluates whether LLMs outperform humans in accuracy, speed, and cost-efficiency during contract review. Empirical analysis benchmarks LLMs against a ground truth set by Senior Lawyers, revealing that advanced models match or exceed human accuracy in identifying legal issues. LLMs complete reviews in seconds, vastly outpacing the hours required by humans. Cost-wise, LLMs achieve a 99.97 percent reduction compared to traditional methods. These findings indicate a transformative shift in legal practice, with LLMs enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of legal services. The research suggests that LLM dominance in legal contract review challenges the status quo, necessitating a reimagined future for legal workflows."
