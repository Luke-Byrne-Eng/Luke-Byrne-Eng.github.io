summary: "The Segment Anything (SA) project introduces a novel task, model, and the largest image segmentation dataset to date, featuring over 1 billion masks across 11 million licensed and privacy-respecting images. The model is engineered for promptability, enabling zero-shot transfer to various image distributions and tasks. Its zero-shot performance has been evaluated across numerous tasks, often matching or surpassing previous fully supervised results. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) and the corresponding SA-1B dataset are made available at https://segment-anything.com to encourage the development of foundational models in computer vision."
