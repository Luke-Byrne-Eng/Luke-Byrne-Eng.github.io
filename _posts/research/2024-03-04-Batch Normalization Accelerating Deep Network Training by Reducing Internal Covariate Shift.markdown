summary: "This paper introduces Batch Normalization, an online normalization technique which calculates mean and std across the batch dimension. Batch Norm improves training efficiency, allowing for higher learning rates, and decreasing hyper-parameter sensitivity, and sometimes removing the need for Dropout regularization. This paper suggests Batch Norm improves internal covariant shift, however later works have questioned this."
