summary: "Monocular depth estimation's success hinges on large, diverse training datasets. Acquiring dense ground-truth depth is challenging, leading to diverse datasets with unique biases. We introduce tools for training with multiple datasets, despite incompatible annotations. Our approach includes a robust training objective unaffected by depth range and scale variations, employs principled multi-objective learning for data integration from various sources, and emphasizes the importance of pretraining encoders on auxiliary tasks. We tested our methods using five datasets, including 3D films, a novel, extensive data source. Through zero-shot cross-dataset transfer, we demonstrate our approach's superior generalization, significantly outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in monocular depth estimation."
