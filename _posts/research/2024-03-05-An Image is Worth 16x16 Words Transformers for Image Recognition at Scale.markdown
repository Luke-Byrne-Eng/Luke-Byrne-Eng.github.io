summary: "This study introduces the Vision Transformer ViT archetecture. The paper shows that a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can achieve impressive results. When pre-trained on large datasets and then applied to various mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (such as ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB), ViT performs comparably or even better than the latest convolutional networks, with significantly less computational cost for training."
