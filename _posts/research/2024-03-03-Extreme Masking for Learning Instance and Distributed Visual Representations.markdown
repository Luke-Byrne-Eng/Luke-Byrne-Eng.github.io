summary: "The paper introduces ExtreMA, a method for learning visual representations by using high levels of token masking (75%-90%) for data augmentation. It employs self-attention and cross-attention blocks to learn spatial and holistic instance representations. Its contributions include demonstrating the effectiveness of random masking for siamese learning, showing that extreme masking accelerates learning and enhances performance."
