summary: "This paper introduces the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA) for learning semantic image representations without hand-crafted data augmentations. This self-supervised method uses multiple crops of an image. Given a context crop the network is trained to predict the embeddings of several target crops. When applied to Vision Transformers, I-JEPA acheived strong performance in various tasks like image classification and depth prediction, outperforming Masked Auto Encoding (MAE) in linear probing when controlling for compute."
