summary: "Image-caption pretraining, crucial for tasks like zero-shot image classification and object detection, faces challenges in aligning multiple concepts from captions to objects in images. We introduce a curriculum learning framework inspired by children's language learning from cognitive science, starting with simple image-caption pairs and gradually increasing complexity by adding more concepts. This method, which leverages knowledge from each phase for subsequent learning, outperforms traditional image-caption training across various settings, including starting from scratch, using pretrained encoders, and in low data scenarios. The code is available at: https://github.com/hayyubi/cur_vl.git."
