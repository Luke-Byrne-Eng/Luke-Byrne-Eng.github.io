summary: "The study presents a novel approach for detection identification of Holstein-Friesian cattle. This technique offers a completely hands-off solution for automated detection, localization, and identification of cattle from overhead images in open herd settings, without the need for re-training when new cattle are introduced. The system utilizes convolutional neural networks and deep metric learning, achieving high accuracy with a 93.8% success rate in identifying cattle unseen during training, using only half of the population."
