summary: "Reinforcement Learning's usability is limited by its high computation times. Curriculum Reinforcement Learning accelerates learning by ordering tasks from simple to hard. Curricula based on Absolute Learning Progress (ALP) have shown success in various environments but waste computation on redundant tasks. This issue is addressed by introducing Self-Paced Absolute Learning Progress (SPALP), a regularization method inspired by Self-Paced Learning. Evaluated in three environments, SPALP achieves performance comparable to ALP in all cases and reaches it faster in two. Further improvements in SPALP's efficiency and performance are also discussed."
