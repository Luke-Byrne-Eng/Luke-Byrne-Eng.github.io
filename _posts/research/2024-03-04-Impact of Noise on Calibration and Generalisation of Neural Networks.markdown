summary: "This study investigates the effects of various noise injection and data augmentation strategies on neural networks (NNs) to enhance generalization, robustness, and calibration. Activation noise is shown to significantly improve generalization across scenarios, while input augmentation noise notably enhances calibration in out-of-distribution data but is less effective for in-distribution data."
