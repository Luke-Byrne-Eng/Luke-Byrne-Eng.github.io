summary: "This paper improves curriculum learning via introduces Dynamic Instance Hardness (DIH), a method that measures a sample's learning difficulty over time. DIH provides a stable indicator of learning progress by tracking the exponential moving average of a sample's hardness. DIHCL enhances learning efficiency and model accuracy without extra computational costs by leveraging data from the training process itself. Tested on 11 datasets, DIHCL surpasses traditional training methods and recent curriculum learning techniques in both efficiency and effectiveness."
