summary: "Recent self-supervised learning approaches for image representation can be broadly divided into contrastive and non-contrastive methods. This study focuses on their theoretical similarities rather than their differences. By developing contrastive and covariance-based non-contrastive criteria that are algebraically related and equivalent under certain conditions, the authors demonstrate the close relationship between these two families. This analysis includes improving SimCLR's performance to match that of VICReg through precise hyperparameter adjustments and challenging the assumption that non-contrastive methods require large output dimensions. Results indicate that with better network design and hyperparameter tuning, the performance gap between contrastive and non-contrastive methods can be minimized."
