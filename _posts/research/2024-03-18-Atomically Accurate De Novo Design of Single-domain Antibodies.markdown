summary: "Despite the critical role antibodies play in medicine, current methods for designing new antibodies targeting specific epitopes are time-consuming. Here, we showcase the effectiveness of a refined RFdiffusion network in designing novel antibody variable heavy chains (VHHâ€™s) to target user-specified epitopes. Through experiments, we validate the binding capability of these designed VHH's to four disease-relevant epitopes. Furthermore, the cryo-EM structure analysis reveals that a designed VHH bound to influenza hemagglutinin closely matches the design model, affirming the accuracy of our approach."
