summary: "This paper presents a novel approach to automatically colorize grayscale photos with vibrant and realistic results. The method frames colorization as a classification task and employs class rebalancing during training to enhance color diversity. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on over a million color images, operating as a feed-forward pass at test time. The algorithm's effectiveness was validated through a colorization Turing test, where it deceived participants in 32% of trials. The paper also illustrates how colorization can serve as an effective pretraining task for self-supervised feature learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks."
