summary: "Label smoothing is hypothesized to mitigate overfitting and enhance generalization, with supporting empirical evidence. However, its mathematical underpinnings remain unclear. This paper introduces a theoretical framework explaining label smoothing's effectiveness in controlling generalization loss, especially in scenarios with partially incorrect training labels. We identify an optimal label smoothing value that minimizes generalization loss and validate our theory with comprehensive experiments. Our results aim to clarify label smoothing's utility for both theoreticians and practitioners in real-world applications"
