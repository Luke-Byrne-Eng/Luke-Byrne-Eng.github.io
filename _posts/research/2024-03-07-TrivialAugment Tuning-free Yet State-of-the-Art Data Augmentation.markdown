summary: "The paper introduces TrivialAugment, a parameter-free and surprisingly effective automatic augmentation method that applies a single augmentation to each image. Despite its minimal complexity and cost, TrivialAugment outperforms existing methods across various image classification scenarios, as validated through extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods and multiple ablation studies involving different augmentation spaces and methods. The work includes a user-friendly interface and fully shared codebase to encourage adoption and reproducibility. Noting a stagnation in automatic augmentation research, the authors conclude by proposing best practices for future advancements in the field."
