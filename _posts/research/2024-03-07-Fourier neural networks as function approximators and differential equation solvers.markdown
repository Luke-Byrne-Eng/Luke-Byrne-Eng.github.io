summary: "This paper introduces a Fourier neural network (FNN) that aligns with Fourier decomposition by utilizing specific activation and loss functions to accurately mimic Fourier series expansion within a simple, single-layer architecture. This design allows for easy integration with more complex networks for data processing tasks. The authors demonstrate the FNN's efficacy on both smooth and piecewise continuous periodic functions and its application in modeling or solving partial differential equations with periodic boundary conditions. Key benefits of the FNN include solution validity beyond the training scope, model interpretability, and ease of use."
