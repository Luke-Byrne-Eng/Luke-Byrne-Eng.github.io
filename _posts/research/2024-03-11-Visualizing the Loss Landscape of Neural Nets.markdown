summary: "This paper delves into the complexities of neural network training, focusing on the quest for effective minimizers of non-convex loss functions. It investigates the impact of network architecture and training parameters on the loss landscape and generalization capabilities. Introducing a filter normalization technique for visualizing loss function curvature, the study explores the influence of architecture and parameters on the shape of minimizers."
