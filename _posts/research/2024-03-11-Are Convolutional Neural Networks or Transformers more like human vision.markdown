summary: "This study investigates the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and attention-based Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks. While CNNs excel in accuracy, ViTs offer a different approach with weaker inductive biases. By analyzing error patterns, we find that ViTs exhibit consistency with human errors, suggesting potential for more human-like vision models and insights into human object recognition."
