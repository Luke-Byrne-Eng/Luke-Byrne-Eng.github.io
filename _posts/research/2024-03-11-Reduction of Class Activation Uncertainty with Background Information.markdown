summary: "This paper proposes a novel approach using a background class to enhance generalization in neural network training, offering computational efficiency compared to multitask learning. We introduce a method for selecting background images and explore potential enhancements. Our approach, applied to various datasets, demonstrates improved generalization with reduced computational cost. Furthermore, by analyzing class activation mappings, we observe a propensity for broader context comprehension in certain classification tasks. Integration of the proposed background class with transformers yields state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including STL-10, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Oxford-102, Caltech-101, and CINIC-10."
