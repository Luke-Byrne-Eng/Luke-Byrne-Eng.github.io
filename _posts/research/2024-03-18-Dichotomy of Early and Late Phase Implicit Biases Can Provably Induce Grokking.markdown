summary: "Power et al. (2022) discovered that neural networks initially memorize arithmetic tasks, achieving perfect training accuracy but poor test accuracy, then suddenly achieve perfect test accuracy after extended training. This study explains this grokking phenomenon with the theory that early and late phase implicit biases cause this shift. Training homogeneous neural networks with large initialization and small weight decay on classification and regression tasks results in a prolonged period where the network acts like a kernel predictor, followed by a sudden shift to min-norm/max-margin predictors, significantly improving test accuracy."
