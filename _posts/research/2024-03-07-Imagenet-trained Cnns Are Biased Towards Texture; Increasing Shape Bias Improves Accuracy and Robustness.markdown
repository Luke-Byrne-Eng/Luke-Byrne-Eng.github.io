summary: "This study challenges the traditional understanding of how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) recognize objects, revealing that they are more biased towards recognizing textures rather than learning complex shapes. The authors found that CNNs trained on ImageNet favor texture over shape, differing significantly from human visual processing. However, training a ResNet-50 on a stylized version of ImageNet, designed to emphasize shape, aligned the network's performance more closely with human behavior. This shape-based training matched human performance in controlled experiments and enhanced object detection and robustness against image distortions, highlighting the benefits of shape-based representations in visual recognition systems."
