summary: "Introuces CAN, a method that combines contrastive learning, masked autoencoders, and noise prediction for efficient and scalable self-supervised visual learning. Its a straightforward framework that enhances image representation learning by leveraging the strengths of each approach. CAN outperforms existing methods in transfer learning and robustness tasks, showing particularly strong performance when pre-training on large, uncurated datasets. It offers a significant efficiency improvement and reduces the computational load compared to previous models."
