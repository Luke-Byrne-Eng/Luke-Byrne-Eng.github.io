summary: "Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are proposed as alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Unlike MLPs with fixed activation functions on nodes, KANs have learnable activation functions on edges. KANs replace linear weights with univariate functions parametrized as splines. This modification enhances KANs' accuracy and interpretability compared to MLPs. Smaller KANs achieve comparable or superior accuracy in data fitting and PDE solving. KANs also exhibit faster neural scaling laws and are more interpretable, allowing intuitive visualization and user interaction. Examples in mathematics and physics demonstrate KANs' utility in helping scientists (re)discover laws. KANs present promising alternatives to MLPs, potentially advancing current deep learning models."
