summary: "This paper demonstrates how to achieve state-of-the-art certified adversarial robustness to ℓ2-norm bounded perturbations using only off-the-shelf pretrained models. The authors instantiate the denoised smoothing approach by combining a pretrained denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a standard high-accuracy classifier. This method certifies 71% accuracy on ImageNet under adversarial perturbations constrained to an ℓ2 norm of ε = 0.5, improving upon the prior certified state-of-the-art by 14 percentage points and denoised smoothing by 30 percentage points, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining of model parameters."
