summary: "Label smoothing is a regularization technique that reduces overfitting and enhances classification performance. Label smothing involves creating soft labels via a weighted blend of the uniform distribution and the hard label. This paper introduces an Online Label Smoothing (OLS) strategy that generates soft labels using model prediction statistics for the target category, creating a more accurate probability distribution. This significantly improves classification accuracy and model robustness to noisy labels."
