summary: "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been prominent in processing visual data, but recent studies show Vision Transformers (ViTs) can match or outperform CNNs in image classification. This work examines how ViTs solve classification tasks, discovering significant differences from CNNs, including uniformity in ViT representations across layers due to self-attention and residual connections that enhance feature propagation. ViTs also maintain spatial information effectively, influenced by classification methods. The study further explores how dataset scale affects ViT features and their transferability, linking these findings to new architectures like MLP-Mixer."
