summary: "Chronos is a framework that enhances pretrained probabilistic time series models by tokenizing time series data for training with transformer-based architectures, notably the T5 family. Pretrained on a mix of public and synthetic datasets created via Gaussian processes, Chronos models outshine others in 42 benchmark datasets by showing superior performance on familiar datasets and competitive or better zero-shot capabilities on new datasets. This illustrates Chronos's ability to generalize across different domains, offering a simpler approach to forecasting tasks."
