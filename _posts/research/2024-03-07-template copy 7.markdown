summary: "We introduce the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU), a neural network activation function that outperforms existing functions by weighting inputs by their magnitude using the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function, unlike ReLU which gates inputs by sign. Our empirical evaluation across computer vision, natural language processing, and speech tasks shows that GELU offers performance improvements over ReLU and ELU activations."
