summary: "This paper addresses grokking, where models achieve delayed generalization long after overfitting. They propose accelerating this process by decomposing parameter gradients into fast-varying (overfitting) and slow-varying (generalization) components. By amplifying the slow-varying gradients, their method, GROKFAST, accelerates generalization over 50 times with minimal code changes. Experiments show effectiveness across tasks involving images, languages, and graphs, making grokking more practical for machine learning practitioners under resource constraints."
