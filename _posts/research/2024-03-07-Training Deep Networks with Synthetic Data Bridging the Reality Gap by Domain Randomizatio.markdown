summary: "We introduce a system that trains deep neural networks for object detection using synthetic images, leveraging domain randomization to manage real-world data variability. This involves randomizing simulator parameters—like lighting and object textures—in non-realistic ways, helping the network to identify essential object features. Our findings reveal that networks can achieve impressive performance with just synthetic data and further improve with real data fine-tuning. This suggests the potential of using cost-effective synthetic data for training, circumventing the challenges of acquiring vast amounts of real-world data or creating detailed synthetic environments. We validate our method through car bounding box detection on the KITTI dataset."
