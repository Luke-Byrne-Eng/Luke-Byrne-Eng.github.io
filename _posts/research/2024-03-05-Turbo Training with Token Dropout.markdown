summary: "This paper introduces Turbo training, an efficient training method for video-related tasks using Transformers. Turbo training offers three major contributions: Firstly, it presents a simple yet versatile training paradigm applicable to multiple video tasks. Secondly, it demonstrates Turbo training's effectiveness across action classification, video-language representation learning, and long-video activity classification, achieving competitive performance with up to 4Ã— speed-up and reduced memory usage. Thirdly, it enables long-schedule video-language training and end-to-end long-video training with limited resources, outperforming or matching previous methods that were resource-intensive."
