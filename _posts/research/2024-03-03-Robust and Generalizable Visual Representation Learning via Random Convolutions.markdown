summary: "This study introduces random convolutions for data augmentation. Random convolutions approximately preserve shape while distorting local textures. This method significantly enhances performance on domain generalization and robustness / corruption benchmarks, including a substantial improvement in generalizing to sketch domains over current state-of-the-art methods."
