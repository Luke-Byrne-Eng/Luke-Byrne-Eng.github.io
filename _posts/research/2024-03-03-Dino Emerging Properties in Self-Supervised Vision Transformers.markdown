summary: "This paper shows self-supervised ViT features contain explicit information about the semantic segmentation of an image, which does not emerge as clearly with supervised ViTs or convnets. Also proposes a modification to BYOL self-supervised learning with a momentum encoder, multi-crop training, and feature sharping for the teacher network."
