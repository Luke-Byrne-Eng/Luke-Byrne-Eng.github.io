summary: "This paper introduces DiffBIR, a framework that utilizes pretrained text-to-image diffusion models for blind image restoration. The two-stage pipeline involves pretraining a restoration module on various degradations to enhance real-world applicability, followed by the use of latent diffusion models for realistic restoration. The authors introduce a novel injective modulation sub-network, LAControlNet, for fine-tuning and employ pre-trained Stable Diffusion for its generative capabilities. Additionally, a controllable module allows users to adjust quality and fidelity during the denoising process. Extensive tests demonstrate DiffBIR's superiority in blind image super-resolution and face restoration tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets."
