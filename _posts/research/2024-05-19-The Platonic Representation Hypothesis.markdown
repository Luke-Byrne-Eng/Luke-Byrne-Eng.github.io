summary: "This paper argues that AI model representations, especially in deep networks, are converging. It surveys examples in the literature showing how neural network representations align over time and across domains. It demonstrates convergence across data modalities, noting that as vision and language models grow, they measure distances between data points similarly. The authors hypothesize that this convergence leads to a shared statistical model of reality, termed the platonic representation and discuss possible selective pressures toward it. The paper also addresses the implications, limitations, and counterexamples to this trend."
