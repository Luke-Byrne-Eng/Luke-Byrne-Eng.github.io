summary: "This paper introduces SlowFast networks, a new convolutional architecture for video recognition tasks. These networks have two pathways: a Slow pathway operating at low frame rates to capture spatial semantics, and a Fast pathway working at high frame rates with reduced channel capacity to efficiently capture motion details. The SlowFast models achieve top accuracy on major video benchmarks like Kinetics, Charades, and AVA, significantly improving performance for action classification and detection tasks."
