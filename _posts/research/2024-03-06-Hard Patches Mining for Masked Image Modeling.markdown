summary: "This paper proposes Hard Patches Mining (HPM), a novel framework for masked image modeling (MIM) pre-training that goes beyond simply solving given problems. HPM aims for the model to generate more challenging tasks for itself, using reconstruction loss as a metric for task difficulty. It incorporates an auxiliary loss predictor to determine which patches to mask based on predicted patch-wise losses, using a strategy to avoid overfitting. Experiments show HPM's effectiveness in creating challenging masked images and enhancing representation quality through the loss prediction objective, highlighting its ability to identify and learn from hard-to-reconstruct areas."
