summary: "Diffusion models, effective for generating high-dimensional perceptual data like images, lack established standard practices. This study enhances noise sampling techniques for training rectified flow models, prioritizing perceptually relevant scales. Our large-scale study demonstrates superior performance over established diffusion methods in high-resolution text-to-image synthesis. We introduce a transformer-based architecture for text-to-image generation, improving text comprehension, typography, and human preference ratings. Our findings show predictable scaling trends, with lower validation loss correlating with improved synthesis. The largest models outperform state-of-the-art approaches, and our data, code, and model weights will be publicly accessible."
