summary: "Cosine similarity, often used to gauge semantic similarity between high-dimensional objects by comparing low-dimensional feature embeddings, can yield variable results compared to unnormalized dot products. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing embeddings from regularized linear models, revealing that cosine similarity can produce arbitrary and even meaningless similarities. This applies not only to linear models but also to deep models due to the implicit effects of various regularizations. Consequently, we advise against relying solely on cosine similarity and suggest exploring alternative approaches."
