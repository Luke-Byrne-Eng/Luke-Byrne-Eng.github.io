summary: "The Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is a self-supervised method previously used for predicting missing input parts. This study expands JEPA to predict a wider range of corruptions by introducing Image World Models (IWM), which learn the effects of global photometric transformations in latent space. Key to effective IWM learning are conditioning, prediction difficulty, and model capacity. The study demonstrates that IWM's predictive world model, when fine-tuned, can tackle diverse tasks and either matches or outperforms existing self-supervised techniques. Additionally, it enables control over the abstraction level of learned representations, achieving either invariant or equivariant representations, similar to contrastive methods or masked image modeling, respectively."
