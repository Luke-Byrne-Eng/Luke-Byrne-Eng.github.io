summary: "This paper introduces FineAction, a large-scale, fine-grained video dataset designed to address the limitations of current temporal action localization (TAL) benchmarks, which rely on coarse action classes and lead to model overfitting and ambiguous annotations. FineAction contains 103K instances across 106 action categories in 17K videos, offering a diverse and densely annotated dataset with co-occurring actions that pose new challenges for TAL. The authors evaluate popular localization methods on FineAction, revealing the impact of fine-grained instances on performance, and propose a baseline method achieving a 13.17% mAP. FineAction aims to advance TAL research and is accessible online."
