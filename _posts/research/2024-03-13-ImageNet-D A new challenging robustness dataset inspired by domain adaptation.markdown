summary: "We introduce ImageNet-D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of ImageNet-trained models across various domains. With six distinct domains including Real, Painting, Clipart, Sketch, Infograph, and Quick-draw, ImageNet-D challenges even state-of-the-art models, revealing interpretable errors. For instance, our leading EfficientNet-L2 model exhibits a significant performance decrease, dropping from 11.6% on clean ImageNet to 29.2% on the Real domain."
