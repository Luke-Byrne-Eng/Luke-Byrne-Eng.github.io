summary: "We propose HYPO, a novel framework for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in machine learning, which learns domain-invariant features in a hyperspherical space. Our method focuses on aligning features of the same class across different domains close to their class prototypes and separating different class prototypes maximally. We offer theoretical justifications for its improvement on OOD generalization and show through experiments on OOD benchmarks that HYPO outperforms existing baselines with superior performance."
