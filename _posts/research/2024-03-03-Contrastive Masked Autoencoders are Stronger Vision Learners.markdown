summary: "Contrastive Masked Autoencoders (CMAE) is a self-supervised method that adds a contrastive loss to the Masked Autoencoder. It features a dual-branch architecture, including an asymmetric encoder-decoder for holistic feature learning and a momentum encoder for boosting feature discriminability through contrastive learning."
