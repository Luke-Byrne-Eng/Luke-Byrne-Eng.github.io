summary: "In this study, we improve upon the fast stylization method by Ulyanov et al. (2016) through a minor yet impactful modification: substituting batch normalization with instance normalization during both training and testing. This adjustment significantly enhances the quality of generated images and enables the training of efficient real-time image generation architectures. The code and full paper are available online."
