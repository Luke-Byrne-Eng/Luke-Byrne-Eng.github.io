summary: "This paper introduces the Kinetics Human Action Video dataset. The authors note that the limited number of videos in existing datasets like UCF-101 and HMDB-51 hinders the ability to effectively evaluate architectures due to similar performance across these small benchmarks. Kinetics contains 400 classes with over 400 video clips per class from challenging YouTube videos. The paper analyzes the impact of this larger dataset on the performance of existing architectures as well as the benefits of pre-training models on Kinetics. The authors introduce the Two-Stream Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D), an extension of 2D ConvNets to 3D for improved video feature extraction. When pre-trained on Kinetics, this I3D model sets new benchmarks for action classification, achieving 80.9% accuracy on HMDB-51 and 98.0% on UCF-101."
