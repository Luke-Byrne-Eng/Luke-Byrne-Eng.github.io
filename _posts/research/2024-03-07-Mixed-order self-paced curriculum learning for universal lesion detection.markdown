summary: "This paper introduces a novel approach called mixed-order self-paced curriculum learning (Mo-SCL) to address the challenges faced by self-paced curriculum learning (SCL) in medical image analysis tasks, such as universal lesion detection. These challenges include inaccurate difficulty estimation and the under-utilization of hard samples. Mo-SCL combines uncertainty and loss for better difficulty estimation and incorporates both hard and easy samples in training batches. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, the authors demonstrate that Mo-SCL enhances lesion detection accuracy in state-of-the-art methods without requiring additional network modifications."
